{"name":"Annew.autofacprofiling","tagline":"","body":"# Annew.AutofacProfiling\r\nThis is a really tiny library that lets you profile Autofac resolutions in MiniProfiler. In short - every time Autofac resolves a component, you get a line in MiniProfiler telling you how long it took. Very handy if you're having trouble tracking down performance issues in apps.\r\n\r\nTo get started:\r\n\r\n1. Install Annew.AutofacProfiling via the NuGet package manager console.\r\n2. Add a call to `EnableProfiling()` when you build your container, as below:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nvar builder = new ContainerBuilder();\r\n// Your registrations go here.\r\nvar container = builder.Build();\r\n// <magic>\r\ncontainer.EnableProfiling();\r\n//</magic>\r\nDependencyResolver.SetResolver(new AutofacDependencyResolver(container));\r\n```\r\n\r\n... and that's it. So long as you've set up MiniProfiler, you'll now get profiling for each component that Autofac resolves, even if it's buried deep down in the object graph.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies:\r\n * Autofac\r\n * MiniProfiler","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
